  "What assumptions about refugees, policy, or education were challenged or reinforced during the game?",
  "How did the group dynamics impact your ability to advocate for certain policies? Were there moments when you chose silence or compromise? Why?",
  "Has your understanding of refugee education shifted from seeing it as a service 'for them' to a system embedded in broader struggles over power, identity, and justice? If so, how?",
  "Whose interests did your decisions ultimately serveâ€”refugees, citizens, or the state? Why?",
  "What power did you assume you had as a policymakerâ€”and who did you imagine was absent or voiceless in that process?",
  "What compromises did you make for the sake of consensus, and who or what got erased in the process?",
  "How did the structure of the game (budget, options, scenario) shape or limit your imagination of justice?",
  "If refugee education wasn't about inclusion into existing systemsâ€”but about transforming those systemsâ€”what would that look like, and did your decisions move toward or away from that?"
